Lets talk about IP
We will have to use assests from somewhere else because there is just not enough time during the class to create all our new assests.

Creative commons,

When you are out there ripping assests, make sure you are not using anything that needs a license.

Mentioned:
White Bat audio on youtube
Audacity for editting audio files
GIMP - GNU Image Manipulation Program
Thinkercad - Create 3D digital designs with online CAD

Crediting IP you game yses:
For ANY assets, you must give a credit to the source.

Most sources will tell you how to credit them. If so, do it the way they tell you.
If not, create a credit giving the creator's identity, the name of the work, the URL you used to obtain it, and the kind of license you have to use it.

-> You don't have to pay for anything
-> Make sure any license includes derivative work

"In the Old days"
Before online stores, and the internet.
How did you get a game? Hardware was leased and the software was included for free.
Software source code was published in books to be typed by the end user.

The Adv Gen is not a game engine. It is more of a compiler.

Event based - Set of events, waiting on input from user
Time based - Set of frames, uses the process loop | do shit then render
