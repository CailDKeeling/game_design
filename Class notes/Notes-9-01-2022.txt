Regarding sales:
The barrier to sales goes way down the cheaper something is. It's a non-linear function.

Cost = total cost to develop the game, publish it, market / promote it.
Revenue = how much revenue can the game be expected to generate.

2 ways = minimize cost or maximize revenue
Unlikely because both are directly proportional.

Games that pump out sequels frequently targeting their fan-base.
Characteristics of this kind of game include...

"niche" status means the Total Availible market is not big enough to even be interesting to the larger organizations.

Franchises that just keep pumping out "new" versions that are the "same" game with just enough difference to avoid fraud.
The players have come to expect a certain type of game which is what keeps bringing them back.

STEAM free games - look at them for ideas
XMines - predates minesweeper by at least 4 years (professor helped write it)
Game mechanics are not IP. Be careful about look and feel. The reasonable person on the street would CONFUSE with someone else's TM or (R).
You can't clone look and feel.
